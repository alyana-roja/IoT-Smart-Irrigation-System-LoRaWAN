# 🌱 Smart Irrigation System using LoRaWAN

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a smart irrigation system that uses **LoRaWAN communication** to monitor soil moisture and control water pumps.  
It reduces water usage, automates irrigation, and enables long-range, low-power wireless monitoring.

## 🔧 Features
- LoRaWAN-based communication between sensor nodes and gateway
- Soil moisture & temperature monitoring
- Automated water pump control
- Data visualization (ThingsBoard / Node-RED / Grafana)
- Low power consumption for field deployment

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `hardware/` → Circuit diagrams & sensor setup
- `firmware/` → Node MCU / ESP32 / Arduino code
- `server/` → Backend & dashboard code
- `docs/` → Project report & research documentation
- `images/` → System photos & diagrams

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- LoRa module (SX1276/78 based)
- Microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino)
- Soil moisture sensors
- Gateway (LoRaWAN or DIY with Raspberry Pi)

### Steps
1. Flash firmware to LoRa node
2. Connect sensors & LoRa module
3. Setup LoRaWAN gateway & server
4. Run backend code for data logging
5. Access dashboard for visualization
